## Notes for Google Play Console

1. **Character Limits**: Google Play allows up to 500 characters for release notes, but you can use more if needed.

2. **Formatting**: Google Play supports basic formatting:
   - Line breaks (press Enter)
   - Bullet points (use • or -)
   - Basic text formatting

3. **Language Tags**: When entering in Google Play Console, you'll see:
   ```xml
   <en-US>
   Your release notes here
   </en-US>
   ```

4. **Multiple Languages**: If you support multiple languages, add release notes for each:
   ```xml
   <en-US>
   English release notes
   </en-US>
   <es-ES>
   Spanish release notes
   </es-ES>
   ```

5. **Best Practices**:
   - Keep it user-focused (what users get, not technical details)
   - Highlight key features and benefits
   - Use clear, simple language
   - Focus on value, not features
   - Keep it scannable (use bullet points)
